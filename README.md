# Forensic-Data-Analyzer-

## About
:wave: Hello! I am Tom Eve and this is my first ever Python project. \
The aim of this app is to quickly test a single column of data in an Excel Spreadsheet for its level of randomness using [Benford's Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law). \
Checking if data fits inside Benford's Distribution is a commonly used method when investigating possible *financial fraud*.

## Setup
```git clone https://github.com/Magnanimoose/Forensic-Data-Analyzer-```
